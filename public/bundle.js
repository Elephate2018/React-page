 * Summary of `ReactBrowserEventEmitter` event handling:
 *
 *  - Top-level delegation is used to trap most native browser events. This
 *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of
 *    ReactDOMEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support
 *    pluggable event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main
 *    thread.
 *
 *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This
 *    may be done in the worker thread.
 *
 *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to
 *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want
 *    to extract any synthetic events.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with
 *    "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.

//
// Like fibers, update queues come in pairs: a current queue, which represents
// the visible state of the screen, and a work-in-progress queue, which is
// can be mutated and processed asynchronously before it is committed — a form
// of double buffering. If a work-in-progress render is discarded before
// finishing, we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.
//
// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an
// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a
// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.
// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than
// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's
// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the
// work-in-progress.
//
// For example:
//
//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F
//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F
//                                          ^
//                                          The work-in-progress queue has
//                                          processed more updates than current.
//
// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop
// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to
// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in
// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add
// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already
// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by
// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next
// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the
// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same
// update twice.)
//
// Prioritization
// --------------
//
// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always
// appended to the end of the list.
//
// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue
// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are
// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient
// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower
// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also
// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority
// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities. We also
// keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first
// update in the queue is applied.
//
// For example:
//
//   Given a base state of '', and the following queue of updates
//
//     A1 - B2 - C1 - D2
//
//   where the number indicates the priority, and the update is applied to the
//   previous state by appending a letter, React will process these updates as
//   two separate renders, one per distinct priority level:
//
//   First render, at priority 1:
//     Base state: ''
//     Updates: [A1, C1]
//     Result state: 'AC'
//
//   Second render, at priority 2:
//     Base state: 'A'            <-  The base state does not include C1,
//                                    because B2 was skipped.
//     Updates: [B2, C1, D2]      <-  C1 was rebased on top of B2
//     Result state: 'ABCD'
//
// Because we process updates in insertion order, and rebase high priority
// updates when preceding updates are skipped, the final result is deterministic
// regardless of priority. Intermediate state may vary according to system
// resources, but the final state is always the same.
